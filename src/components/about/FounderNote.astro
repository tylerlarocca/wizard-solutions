          <p>
            I’ve always loved helping people figure things out — especially when the problem feels complicated,
            technical, or overwhelming.
          </p>

          <p>
            Long before this became a business, I was the person friends, founders, and organizations came to
            when something wasn’t working. I’ve always been comfortable in the technical space, but what really
            drew me in was finding solutions that actually helped people move forward.
          </p>

          <p>
            This work isn’t just a job for me. It’s about relationships — working with good people, supporting
            meaningful projects, and helping businesses and non-profits do more with the resources they have.
          </p>

          <p>
            After seeing too many teams get burned by agencies and vendors, I wanted to offer something different:
            a trusted technical partner you can rely on — without the cost or commitment of a full-time hire.
          </p>

          <p>
            My background includes a Master’s degree in Education alongside formal technical training and real-world
            software experience. That combination shapes how I work: clear communication, thoughtful execution,
            and systems people actually understand.
